# BroadSign Player - Docker

# Notes

It is extremely important to run this image using Ubuntu on Wayland only. Otherwise BroadSign Player glitches out.

# Usage

Simply clone the repo and build the image:

```
sudo docker-compose build
```

Then, start the image with all of the required configuration by running:

```
sudo docker-compose up
```

That's it!
